# Unraid-ErgoNode
Allows you to run a ERGO node on your unRAID server using the OFFICIAL DOCKER.  While syncing to the current height, your docker might crash  and it might take a wile (few hours to a day at most) depending  on your cpu and ram.   Once the sync is done you can setup your wallet following the blog: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup - UI for the wallet can be found at [IP]:[PORT:9053]/panel - For the swagger [IP]:[PORT:9053]/swagger
