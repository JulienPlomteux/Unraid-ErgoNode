# Unraid-ErgoNode
Allows you to run a ERGO node on your unRAID server using the OFFICIAL DOCKER.  </br> While syncing to the current height, your docker might crash  and it might take a wile (few hours to a day at most) depending  on your cpu and ram.  </br> Once the sync is done you can setup your wallet following the blog: https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_12_02_how_to_setup  </br> - UI for the wallet can be found at [IP]:[PORT:9053]/panel  </br> - For the swagger [IP]:[PORT:9053]/swagger </br> </br> If you have any questions send me a message at https://forums.unraid.net/profile/163009-mrlafontaine/
